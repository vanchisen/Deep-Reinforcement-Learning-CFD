# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-CFD
deep reinforcement learning using the simulated data from the spectral element/Fourier code Nektar

# tar xzvf Nektar_DRL.tar.gz
# tar DRL.tar.gz 

After extracint, there is a ReadMe.txt under Nektar_DRL/ that gives how to compile the spectral-element/Fourier CFD code
DRL.tar.gz has all the DRL python code used in DRL training.
xmlrpc is required.
